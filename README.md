# WebBrowser
A custom web browser implementation written in C++.

# Build Instructions
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CianOSullivan/WebBrowser
```

To run the browser:

```
cd WebBrowser
make
./main
```

The browser should then be running an it's own window!

NOTE: Most of the work thus far is parsing and DOM Tree manipulation so the GUI still needs to be built.
